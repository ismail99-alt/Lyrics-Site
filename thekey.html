   <h2><u>THE KEY LYRICS</u></h2>
   <hr>
   <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>In adalucian morning light</p>
    <p>In the seas of azure dawning skies</p>
    <p>I watch you bloom the birth of spring</p>
    <p>You're the song that all lovers sing</p>
    <p>You're the key holding me in</p>
    <br>
    <!-- No chorus for this song, the last two lines of each verse is the chorus -->
    <p>I am a prisoner I can't escape</p>
    <p>The key is inside the forms you take</p>
    <p>You're the web I cannot spin</p>
    <p>You're the pulse beneath my skin</p>
    <p>You're the key holding me in</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your love is a door I cannot find</p>
    <p>The only way out is to deep inside</p>
    <p>I'm humbled by the light you take</p>
    <p>When you cover every color of the day</p>
    <p>I'm brighten by the night you bring</p>
    <p>You're the divine eternal ring</p>
    <p>You're the end that everything begins</p>
    <p>You're the key holding me in</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm humbled by the light you take</p>
    <p>When you cover every color of the day</p>
    <p>Illuminated in the night you bring</p>
    <p>You're the divine eternal ring</p>
    <p>You're the end that everything begins</p>
    <p>You're the key holding me in</p>
    <p>The only key holding me in</p>
